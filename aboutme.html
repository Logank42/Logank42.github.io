<h1>Random things about me:</h1>
<p>I have a dog and have always had a love for animals. Recently I've been wanting to get ducks, but I wont be able to until I move out. I like playing video games and sports. I've been in a sport my whole life and have done football, basketball, lacrosse, tennis, pickleball and swimming. Computers have interested me but I never learned about them until recently, and I joined this class. I am looking foward to the year for school and sports.</p>
