    <h4>About me:</h4>
    <p>I am Logan Kirkpatrick, and I am in the warren tech cyber security program. I have played lacrosse my whole life and recently decided I want to learn how to code. I am starting to pick up on it but its difficult. I am excited as I am learning more and am striving to get a better understanding.</p>
